      "The road was long and hot. We passed trees, birds, and small rivers.",
      "Most of the time, the only sounds were our steps and the wind.",
      "Still, I felt something in the air. The forest seemed quiet‚Äîbut in a different way, like it was waiting for us.",
      "After hours of walking, we reached a cave.",
      "From the outside, it didn‚Äôt look special.",
      "But when I stepped inside, the air turned cold, and the light from the entrance didn‚Äôt follow me far.",
      "The walls were covered in pictures. Some showed people, others strange shapes.",
      "One looked like the sun and moon together. Another showed three people with something glowing around them.",
      "I couldn‚Äôt explain it, but I felt a strong emotion. It wasn‚Äôt fear‚Äîmore like a heavy feeling in my chest.",
      "Something about the pictures felt personal, like they were part of a story I had forgotten.",
      "As the day ended, we began to walk back. But the forest had changed.",
      "The air was colder. The wind was louder. The trees didn‚Äôt feel the same.",
      "Then we heard a sound behind us. Juan looked at me. We both stopped walking.",
      "I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre alone, he said.",
      "From the shadows, an old man stepped out.",
      "His face was serious, and he wore long clothes that moved in the wind.",
      "At first, he said nothing. Then he looked at us and spoke.",
      "You were inside the cave. We stayed silent.",
      "He nodded. Be careful. That place holds more than pictures.",
      "Without another word, he turned and walked away into the dark.",
      "We stood there for a moment. I looked at Juan. He looked back at me.",
      "Something had changed. This was only the beginning."
