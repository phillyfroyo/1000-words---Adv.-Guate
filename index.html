      <div class="sentence-block">My name is Pedro, and I live in a quiet town in Guatemala.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">One afternoon, my friend Juan came over with something in his hand. It was a map.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">The paper looked old, like it had been hidden for a long time.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">Faded lines ran across it, leading into the forest.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">We studied it together, trying to understand what it meant.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">"Maybe it leads to something important," Juan said. I agreed.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">The next morning, we packed a few things and left before the sun was high.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">The road was long and hot. We passed trees, birds, and small rivers.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">Most of the time, the only sounds were our steps and the wind.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">Still, I felt something in the air. The forest seemed quiet—but in a different way, like it was waiting for us.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">After hours of walking, we reached a cave.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">From the outside, it didn’t look special.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">But when I stepped inside, the air turned cold, and the light from the entrance didn’t follow me far.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">The walls were covered in pictures. Some showed people, others strange shapes.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">One looked like the sun and moon together. Another showed three people with something glowing around them.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">I couldn’t explain it, but I felt a strong emotion. It wasn’t fear—more like a heavy feeling in my chest.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">Something about the pictures felt personal, like they were part of a story I had forgotten.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">As the day ended, we began to walk back. But the forest had changed.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">The air was colder. The wind was louder. The trees didn’t feel the same.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">Then we heard a sound behind us. Juan looked at me. We both stopped walking.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">"I don’t think we’re alone," he said.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">From the shadows, an old man stepped out.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">His face was serious, and he wore long clothes that moved in the wind.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">At first, he said nothing. Then he looked at us and spoke.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">"You were inside the cave." We stayed silent.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">He nodded. "Be careful. That place holds more than pictures."</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">Without another word, he turned and walked away into the dark.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">We stood there for a moment. I looked at Juan. He looked back at me.</div>
      <div class="sentence-block">Something had changed. This was only the beginning.</div>
